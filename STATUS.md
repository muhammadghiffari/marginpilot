# STATUS (update at the end of every task; agents load this each session)

Last updated: 2026-10-20 by Dev B. Synced `origin/main` at `52cece8` (A-04.2). B-01..B-06 done (`packages/core`, 83 tests); D-025 merged; D-026..D-028 confirmed. `docs/reviews/DEV-A-sync.md` records the cross-check: 44 Foundry tests pass, LendingSim HFs match the pinned values, EIP-712 mandate set verified against viem, execute/ABIs still missing, and the mock SWAP fee/minAmountOut mismatch was fixed (`7cac091`). `opencode.json` allows non-force `origin` pushes and denies credential files; `git ls-remote origin` succeeded. Local push is blocked by missing git credentials (see Blockers).

## Milestones
- [ ] M0 Setup done (both machines pass `scripts/preflight.sh`; repo pushed; keys funded) — Owner
- [ ] M1 Foundations: contracts compile + core types/optimizer tests green; `MockChainPort` ready
- [ ] M2 End-to-end on anvil: S1 + S7 automated, agent drives vault via `ViemChainPort`
- [ ] M3 Testnet: deployed, S1/S2/S7 (+S3/S4) with real tx hashes in `evidence/`
- [ ] M4 Eval + docs: `pnpm eval:run` results, security self-assessment, tech doc filled
- [ ] M5 Public URL live, final verification, submitted

## Pinned versions (fill when installed: forge-std, OpenZeppelin if used, solc, viem, zod, vitest, Fastify/Express, Vite)
- solc 0.8.24 (`contracts/foundry.toml`)
- forge-std v1.17.0 (`f3dae6e`, `contracts/foundry.lock`)
- OpenZeppelin v5.0.2 (`dbb6104`, `contracts/foundry.lock`)

## Spec notes for Dev B (2026-10-20)
- **EIP-712:** arrays use standard encoding (each address padded to 32 bytes, concatenated, `keccak256`), not `abi.encodePacked(address[])`. `SET_MANDATE_TYPEHASH` is the full EIP-712 `encodeType` hash, including the referenced `Mandate` type string. viem's `hashTypedData` already does both; `INTERFACES.md` §8 types are unchanged.
- **Events:** vault pause events are `VaultPaused` / `VaultUnpaused`; the error remains `Paused` (D-022). Update any ABI/event usage accordingly.

## Blockers
- B-08 is blocked on A-04 (full execute/EIP-712/ABI) and A-07 (`Deploy.s.sol`, `deployments/<chainId>.json`, `packages/core/src/abi/`, `eval/fixtures/base.json`). See `docs/reviews/DEV-A-sync.md`.
- Push to `origin` is blocked: WSL git has `credential.helper = NONE`. Owner must run the two push commands from a shell with cached credentials; no credential file was read.

## Decisions needed from human
See `docs/DECISIONS.md` rows with OPEN/VERIFY (D-003, D-006, D-013, D-016, D-020, D-021). D-018 is superseded by D-027.
